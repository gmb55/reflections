How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Cos it's important to have a chance do a fast back-up 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Manual is better, cos you commit only that what you want, it is clean for you. If you have habit to make a commits 
you don't have to worry about you forget make ones and everything what you done i gone. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, 
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Cos Google Docs works with one file and there are very few situations where one file affects to another. 
In coding this situations is more common. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Log - display list of commits. Diff - display differences between two commits. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Cos you can allway do a back-up and restore previous settings. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Nothing special. Just things that are in lessons. Get to used to make commits.
